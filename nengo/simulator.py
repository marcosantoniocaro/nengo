        dt : float
            The length of a simulator timestep, in seconds.
        seed : int
            A seed for all stochastic operators used in this simulator.
            Note that there are not stochastic operators implemented
            currently, so this parameters does nothing.
        model : nengo.builder.Model instance or None

            build artifacts in the Model before building the network,
